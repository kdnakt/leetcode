/**
 * Given a positive integer num,
 * output its complement number.
 * The complement strategy is to flip the bits of
 * its binary representation.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of
 *   a 32-bit signed integer.
 * num >= 1
 * You could assume no leading zero bit
 *   in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
 * This question is the same as 1009:
 *   https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
